## Education
- Master of Science in Robotics and Autunomous Systems at University of Lincoln (2023 -2024)
- BTech in Electronics and Communication Engineering at Gauhati University (2018- 2022)

## Experince 
- Graduate Student Researcher [ Lincoln Centre for Autonomous Systems (L-CAS) ] 
  - As a Graduate Student Researcher at the Lincoln Centre for Autonomous Systems, active contributions are
being made by me to the development of a multitasking robot scheduled for the upcoming Robocup 2024 at
Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands. Responsibilities encompass the training of the robot
to identify and manipulate various objects through the implementation of Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNN). Additionally, involvement in the integration of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques is
evident, where voice data from human interaction is received and converted into text, enhancing the robotâ€™s
ability to interact seamlessly with users. This experience has allowed the application of expertise in machine
learning and artificial intelligence to real-world robotics challenges, demonstrating a commitment to advancing
autonomous systems technology.Visit the official website - https://lcastor.blogs.lincoln.ac.uk/
